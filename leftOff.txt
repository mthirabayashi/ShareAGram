SUNDAY - 11/6
  + left off on likes component.
  + have createLike working from the PostsIndex -> PostItem
  - need to add a likedPosts array under currentUser
  - need to have createLike success update currentUsers list of liked posts
  -+ createPost might already be updating PostsIndex so may only have to add an update currentUser call on createPost success callback

MONDAY - 11/7
  + finished like component
  + ended up having to update currentUser and PostIndex separately. Have weird issue where I have to return a nested currentUser object...
  - need to start Comments
